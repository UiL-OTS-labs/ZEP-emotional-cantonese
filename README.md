A 4AFC speech perception exeriment that investigates emotional context effects on word meanings in spoken mandarin Chinese.

In tonal languages (mainly Asian languages) the 'tone' of speech sounds is a crucial aspect for their meaning.

To complicate matters even more, the emotional context (and intonation too, regardless) may also play an important role, even in tone languages. 
 
In this study, Native Manadarin speakers are compared to Dutch learners of Mandarin (L2). Simple sentences have been prepared by professional voice actors, reading sentences aloud with the following emotions in them "exaggerated".
