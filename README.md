# ZEP-emotional-mandarin

A 4AFC speech perception exeriment that investigates emotional context effects 
on word meanings in spoken mandarin Chinese.

## Context & Purpose

In tonal languages (mainly Asian languages) the 'tone' of speech sounds is a 
crucial aspect for their meaning. Due to this, L2 learners usually struggle a 
lot when learning such a language, since most European languages use tone only 
for intonation, not word meaning. To complicate matters even more, the 
emotional context (and intonation too, regardless) may also play an important 
role, even in tone languages. 

## Task 

In this study, Native Manadarin speakers are compared to Dutch learners of 
Mandarin (L2). Simple sentences have been prepared by professional voice 
actors, reading target nonwords embedded in carrier sentences. Participants
ara asked to select the **tone** of a target nonword. The latin square design 
is implemented.

# Conditions

Conditions are mixed "latin squared" variations of this matrix:

**Condition               |   I         |    II       |   III       |   IV  
--------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------
**Target** syllable       |   mong      |    ra       |   ging      |   bu  
**Tone**                  |  T1         |  T2         |   T3        |   T4 
**Carrier sentence**      | "Point"     | "Read"      | "Practice"  | "Write"
**Emotion**               | Neutral     | Happy       |   Sad       | Angry
